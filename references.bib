Those models are well suited to capture the semi-structured processes present in final product assembly tasks. But in contrast to pure activity recognition systems, which map sensor data to executed activities, those models are able to track the context of the user, and to reason about context variables which are not directly observable through sensors. We describe our modelling approach and report on first evaluation results.},

  abstract      = {Engagement in cognitively stimulating activities is today among the most effective measures against the decline of cognitive abilities due to dementing disorders. Outdoor and social activities are cognitively demanding and provide emotional support at the same time. Alzheimer's disease as the most frequent cause of the dementia syndrome, however, early effects skills for spatial orientation while it simultaneously impedes planning and error compensation abilities. These abilities are necessary to overcome disorientation in unfamiliar environments. People with dementia progressively limit their life-space and diversity of activities in reaction to growing security concerns. It is desirable to provide appropriate guidance in disoriented situations to avoid dangers, while not, in addition, complicating normal mobility in order to maintain a person's life-space, activity spectrum and cognitive health. Such guidance system has to be situation-aware and adaptive. Consequently, the mobility behavior of a patient must be modeled. In addition, the system must be able to learn and detect states of disorientation. In this paper we describe a pilot study to collect mobility data from dementia patients. Furthermore, we examine the collected data's quality and investigate how to detect states of disorientation within the data.},

However, currently there is no support for earlier stages of research projects in the context of behaviour monitoring such as data collection. With the rise of solutions based on information and communication technologies (ICT), the number of clinical studies using such technologies increases. Thus, the need to support collaboration during earlier project phases increases as data collection has to be monitored remotely. We developed a VRE to provide support during all phases of ICT based studies. During a study on agitated behaviour of people with dementia based on ICT solutions, we employed this VRE. In this paper, we describe the VRE and its features with respect to the research project.},

  abstract      = {The annotation of human activity is a crucial prerequisite for applying methods of supervised machine learning. It is typically either obtained by live annotation by the participant or by video log analysis afterwards. Both methods, however, suffer from disadvantages when applied in dementia related nursing homes. On the one hand, people suffering from dementia are not able to produce such annotation and on the other hand, video observation requires high technical effort. The research domain of quality of care addresses these issues by providing observation tools that allow the simultaneous live observation of up to eight participants -- dementia care mapping (DCM). We developed an annotation scheme based on the popular clinical observation tool DCM to obtain annotation about challenging behaviours. In this paper, we report our experiences with this approach and discuss the applicability of clinical observation tools in the domain of automatic human activity assessment.},

In this paper we present an information fusion approach based on causal models. Prior knowledge is used to solve the simultaneous identification and multi target tracking problem. Based on an experimental setting, we show that the proposed approach enables tracking up to five persons.

  abstract      = {Activity recognition is a challenging research problem in ubiquitous computing domain and has to tackle omnipresent uncertainties, e.g., resulting from ambiguous or intermittent sensor readings. In this paper, we introduce an activity recog- nition approach based on causal modeling and probabilistic plan recognition. To evaluate the performance of our approach systematically, we generated sensor data with different error rates using a simulation. This data served as input for the activity recognition in a series of experiments. In these experiments we stepwise introduced and combined additional sources of uncertainty, i.e., different duration mod- els and ignoring certain sensors, to demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Our evaluation shows that Computational Causal Behavior Models provide a basis for a robust activity recognition system.},

  abstract      = {Actigraphy can be used to examine the sleep pattern of patients during the course of the day in their common
environment. However, conventional sleep detection algorithms may not be appropriate for real-world day-
time sleep detection, since they tend to overestimate the sleep state and have only been validated for nighttime
sleep in a laboratory setting. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of a set of new sleep detection algo-
rithms based on machine learning methods in a real-world setting and compared them to two conventional
sleep detection algorithms (Cole's algorithm and Sadeh's algorithm). For that, we performed two studies with
(1) healthy young adults and (2) nursing home residents with Alzheimer's dementia. The conventional algo-
rithms performed poorly for these real-world data sets, because they are imbalanced with respect to sensitivity
and specificity. A more balanced Hidden Markov Model-based algorithm surpassed the conventional algo-
rithms for both data sets. Using this algorithm leads to an improved accuracy of 4.1 percent points (pp) and
23.5 pp, respectively, compared to the conventional algorithms. The Youden-Index improved by 7.3 and 7.7,
respectively. Overall, for a real-world setting, the HMM-based algorithm achieved a performance similar to
conventional algorithms in a laboratory environment.},

Dabei stellt die Vermittlung physikalischer Inhalte eine gro{\ss}e Herausforderung dar.

Gemeinsam mit Lehramtsstudierenden wurde hierzu eine Lernumgebung für SchülerInnen zum Thema Zeit entwickelt. Aus der erfolgreichen Umsetzung dieser Lernumgebung ist ein innovativer Forschungsprozess zur Untersuchung von Interaktionsprozessen hervorgegangen. In Form einer Laborstudie wurde dieses Forschungsprojekt als Interventionsstudie im Schuljahr 2015/16 in einem computergestützten Labor pilotiert. Die stete Bewegung zwischen Praxis und Forschung hin zu einem forschungsbasierten Lehr-Lern-Prozess und dessen Auslösern sowie Wirkzusammenhängen werden im Fokus der Präsentation stehen.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognizing activities has become increasingly relevant in many application domains, such as security or ambient assisted living. To handle different scenarios, the underlying automated algorithms are configured using multiple input parameters. However, the in- fluence and interplay of these parameters is often not clear, making exhaustive evaluations necessary. On this account, we propose a visual analytics approach to supporting users in understanding the complex relationships among parameters, recognized activities, and associated accuracies. First, representative parameter settings are determined. Then, the respective output is computed and statisti- cally analyzed to assess parameters' influence in general. Finally, visualizing the parameter settings along with the activities provides overview and allows to investigate the computed results in detail. Coordinated interaction helps to explore dependencies, compare different settings, and examine individual activities. By integrating automated, visual, and interactive means users can select parameter values that meet desired quality criteria. We demonstrate the application of our solution in a use case with realistic complexity, involving a study of human protagonists in daily living with respect to hundreds of parameter settings.},

  abstract      = {INTRODUCTION: Assessment of challenging behaviors in dementia is an important prerequisite for intervention selection. Here, we aimed to determine the feasibility of complex multidimensional behavior assessment in unrestricted nursing care.
METHODS: We conducted 4 weeks of multimodal sensor assessment together with real time observation and video recordings of 17 residents with moderate to severe dementia in dementia care units. 
RESULTS: Almost 100\% of participants exhibited relevant levels of challenging behaviors. The overall completeness of data acquisition was 73\%, including behavior annotation, sensor data and video recordings. The reliability of behavior annotation was low. 
DISCUSSION: Complex assessment was feasible in routine care. The limited reliability of behavior observations underscores the usefulness of video recordings for post hoc behavior annotation as ground truth for sensor data training. The established technical platform allowed remote control of an autonomous local computer system and combined feasibility of data handling with a high level of data safety.},

Research datasets following these principles are beneficial for the scientific community as they can be semantically interconnected with other datasets and, thus, be reused. Semantic interoperability, however, requires metadata standards to be employed throughout the entire research process. In the biomedical domain, many experiments are conducted in the wet-lab and documented by laboratory notebooks. The recent shift from paper-based laboratory notebooks to electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) enables researchers to build their documentation upon templates to enforce a standardised documentation. In this poster, we advocate the use of ELNs together with Minimum Information guidelines and standards for laboratory data. The early adoption of standardized vocabularies, taxonomies, and ontologies, such as UMLS, MeSH, or ICD-10 will support the uptake of ELNs and ease the documentation process. The application of standards during the documentation process will in turn ease the creation of FAIR research data, and contribute to the further development of automated mechanisms for data extraction from ELNs. As a result, research data will gain higher quality and be collected following more standardized operating procedures, thus, fostering the reusability of work done in the laboratory. Beside the standardization of ELNs in the biomedical domain, the clinical domain will benefit from the possibility to create structured, semantically enriched knowledge that could be leveraged in electronic health records.},

  abstract  = {The analysis of textual variants of verses in the New Testament across different manuscripts has mainly been done by close reading with manual effort. With the increasing number of transcriptions of the different manuscripts, quantitative analyses (so-called distant reading) can be used to search for patterns of omission, addition, or other variations, to formulate novel hypotheses to be investigated by close reading. In this work, we present a corpus of biblical names including spelling variation and inflections and their mentions in the transcriptions of the New Testament. By integrating and semantically enriching the data collected from different sources, we established a corpus that can be used for the quantitative study of omission, addition, and variation of such biblical names. To illustrate the corpus, we implement some use cases and show that well-known cases can be quantitatively reproduced. The corpus and all code are published under open licenses to enable reproduction, update, and maintenance.},

  abstract  = {The use of software in acquiring, analyzing, and interpreting research data underscores its role as an essential artifact of scientific inquiry.Understanding and tracing the provenance of software in research helps in reproducible and collaborative research works.In this paper, we present an overview of our second iteration of the \textbf{So}ftware \textbf{M}ention \textbf{D}etection (SOMD) shared task as a part of the Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) workshop, that will be held in conjunction with ACL in 2025. We intend to foster among participants to brainstorm for optimized software mention detection and additional attributes and relation extraction tasks in the provided gold standard benchmark. Our shared task has two phases of challenges. First, the participants focus on implementing a joint framework for NER and RE for the given dataset. At the same time, the second phase includes the out-of-distribution dataset to evaluate the generalizability of the methods proposed in Phase I. The competition (March-April 2025) attracted 18 participants and spanned two months. Four teams have finished the competition and submitted full system descriptions. Participants applied various approaches, including joint and pipeline models, and explored data augmentation with LLM-generated samples.The evaluation was based on a macro-F1 score for both NER and RE, with the average reported as the SOMD-score.The winning teams achieved a SOMD-score of 0.89 in Phase I and 0.63 in Phase II, demonstrating the challenge of generalization.},
