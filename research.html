								<h2>Research</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								My research interests include Data Science, Natural Language Processing, and Research Data Management with a strong focus on <em>Open Science</em> and <em>Reproducibility</em>.
								My work focusses on methods for information and data management by using techniques of natural language processing and data mining in multiple disciplines such as life-, natural-, and information sciences, but also Digital Humanities and Theology.
							</p>


							<p>Currently, I am PI of the following projects and lead sub projects for <em>Data Literacy</em> and <em>Research Data Management</em>.</p>
							
							
							<h2 id="research-data-management--crc-1270-elaine">Research Data Management @ CRC 1270 ELAINE</h2>
							<p>
								The research vision pursued by the <a href="https://www.elaine.uni-rostock.de/en">Collaborative Research Centre 1270 ELAINE</a> focuses on novel electrically active implants. Specifically, we address implants employed for the regeneration of bone and cartilage, and implants for deep brain stimulation to treat movement disorders.
							</p>
							<p>
								The <a href="https://www.elaine.uni-rostock.de/en/projects/service-projects/project-inf">infrastructure support project</a> addresses the professional management of research data raised, processed and archived in the research projects. Its overarching goal is to ensure the quality, productivity and competitiveness of the CRC in terms of data management. A comprehensive data management plan will be negotiated and implemented. A training and qualification programme for the foundations of reproducible research, open science and data management will also be provided. The promotion of open science is a central objective.
							</p>
							<p>
								The virtual research environment of the CRC 1270 ELAINE enables the web-based collaboration of the involved researchers during the entire research process, i.e. starting at the research hypothesis and ending at the publication of the research results. This improves the reproducibility and the traceability of the scientific investigations by providing central mechanisms for storage, exchange and documentation of research data and software. For this purpose specialised services are employed and integrated into each other.
							</p>
							<p>
								Central research aspects are:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Collaboration in multiple disciplinary research projects in virtual research environments</li>
								<li>Traceability of research processes and Quality assurance of research data by standardized documentation and automatic processed</li>
								<li>Semantic documentation of research data and processes by natural language processing</li>
							</ol>
							<ul>

									<strong>Duration</strong>: 2021&#8211;2025

							<h2 id="data-literacy--digital-campus-rostock-dicaro">Data Literacy @ Digital Campus Rostock (DiCaRo)</h2>
							<p>
								The aim of DiCaRo is to develop an interdisciplinary and interfaculty module in the elective area of the study programs of the University of Rostock, starting with the Faculty of Theology and the Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. At its core is an interdisciplinary teaching and training concept, &#8220;Data Literacy&#8221;, which aims to promote a whole range of information and data competencies, starting with a basic understanding of the mechanisms of data processing and analysis, through critical source reflection, to social and ethical implications in the context of digitalization. The module will be made available as an open educational resource.
							</p>
							<p>
								The goal of the sub project <a href="https://www.dicaro.uni-rostock.de/en/teilprojekte/diss-data-literacy/"><em>Digital Scholar Ship</em></a> is the development of open educational resources for interdisciplinary data literacy education. We aim at developing an interdisciplinary and interfaculty module in the elective area of the study programs of the University of Rostock, starting with the Faculty of Theology and the Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Data Literacy aims to promote a whole range of information and data competencies, starting with a basic understanding of the mechanisms of data processing and analysis, through critical source reflection, to social and ethical implications in the context of digitalization.
